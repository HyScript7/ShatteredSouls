## About

ShatteredSouls is a mechanic inspired\* by DeathBan, LifeSteal and Verdant Moon (Roblox game)
It is a mechanic at it's core lays somewhere between deathban and lifesteal.
When a player dies to another player, the attacker is prompted if they want to "shatter" or "spare" their soul.
Sparing let's doesn't decrease the victims lifes.
Shattering decreases the victims lifes by 1.
Once a player doesn't have any lifes left, they are sent to a world called "The Abyss" for 1 real life day. (Time counts even if the server is off or the player is not online)
